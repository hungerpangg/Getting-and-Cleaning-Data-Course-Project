# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

This repository contains the R code and relevant files for the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project" available on Coursera.

## Overview of the files

This repository contains the following files:

* README.md, this file provides a high level view of the files and code in the repository.

* mean_std_tidy.txt, contains the tidy data set. This can be re-created by running the run.analysis.R file in RStudio. 

* CodeBook.md, the code book which describes the data set in more detail, such as the source of the data, the variables and transformations used to create the tidy dataset.

* run.analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the tidy dataset. This code can run in RStudio by just importing the file. However, take note that the methods used to access the data in this file is personalised to the project owner's local computer, hence you may need to personalise the file.path to your own local computer for it to run smoothly.
